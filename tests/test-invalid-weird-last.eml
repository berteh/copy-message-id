         - Test
         - invalid
         - weird
         - last

The test settings are:

- The Message-ID header is invalid.
- The content has all the bad things you can imagine: Only right-sided angle brackets, spaces, CRLF, unbalanced parentheses...
- The Message-ID is the last header.

Happy testing!
