The test settings are:

- The Message-ID header is a folded row.
- The key is all uppercase.
- It has comments with folding inside the comment before the ID.
- It has comments with folding inside the comment after the ID.
- There is a header after Message-ID. But it's not a canonical header, but a weird header.

Happy testing!
